### Installation

From the command line: `apm install atom-cobalt-material-syntax`

Or directly in Atom:

### Note
In some atom grammars for [R](https://cran.r-project.org/), notably [language-r](https://github.com/lee-dohm/language-r),    >= is not recognised as a single comparison operator. The solution is to use [atom-language-r](https://github.com/REditorSupport/atom-language-r).
