# Atom Cobalt Material Syntax

A dark blue theme that takes the classic Cobalt and Material themes and smashes them together. Inspired by Silvestre Herrera's [Atom Material Syntax](https://atom.io/themes/atom-material-syntax).

Also check out [Atom Minimal UI](https://atom.io/themes/atom-minimal-ui) for a user interface that works beautifully with most syntax themes.

### Installation

From the command line: `apm install atom-cobalt-material-syntax`

Or directly in Atom:

1. Open __Settings__ > __Install__
2. Set the filter to __Themes__
3. Search for `atom-cobalt-material-syntax` and click __Install__


### Note
In some atom grammars for [R](https://cran.r-project.org/), notably [language-r](https://atom.io/packages/language-r),    >= is not recognised as a single comparison operator. The solution is to use [atom-language-r](https://atom.io/packages/atom-language-r).
